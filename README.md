## ⚙️ Project Configuration & Tooling

**ProjectLoL** is a modern web application designed for discovering, reading, authoring, and publishing *Dungeons & Dragons* modules/content. It is built with a modular frontend architecture using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for rapid development and optimized builds. The project leverages a JavaScript-centric stack, with the following key components:

> **Note:** This is a school project and is a work in progress.

- **Frontend**: Utilizes component-bsed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- **Package Management**: Managed via `npm`, with dependencies and scripts defined in `package.json`.

- **Version Control**: Git is used for version control, with a `.gitignore` file specifying untracked files and directories.

- **Project Structure**: The `src/` directory contains the source code, indicating a separation of concerns and organized codebase.

This configuration provides a robust foundation for building a responsive and interactive web application tailored for the D&D community.
